GNU social was again accepted into the Google Summer of Code program. View
[our GSoC website](https://www.diogo.site/projects/GNU-social/soc/) for details. Our [ideas list](https://www.diogo.site/projects/GNU-social/soc/2020) was already published. You're welcome to propose other ideas in the chat or on the issue tracker.

## Results from last year

![](https://www.diogo.site/projects/GNU-social/soc/2019/coding_environment.jpg)

In our last GSoC, we mentored two students who both completed their projects.

Bruno Casteleiro improved OpenID support, improved our URLMapper, started work in the The Free Network module - an essential
element to ensure a fluid transition between federation protocols. He also improved the existing ActivityPub support by
adding queues, collection caching and proper audience targetting. You can find his technical report [here](https://www.diogo.site/projects/GNU-social/soc/2019/tech_report/network/).

Miguel Dantas improved embedded media support as well as general media handling and improved both the existing caching and queueing system. You can find his technical report [here](https://www.diogo.site/projects/GNU-social/soc/2019/tech_report/load/).

## What a summer!

We are truly proud of all the progress we made with the help of our students. GNU social mentees have to submit code on the level of typical contributors without spoon-feeding and that's something achieved in all of ours GSoC editions.

A GNU social contributor deals with {reliability, software and computer security} engineering. Mastery with full-stack web development and git is acquired in a hands-on way without ever dismissing theoretical computer science teachings for optimal efficiency and effective designs.

GNU social is a beautiful software that follows GNU and UNIX philosophies by heart.

A big thanks for all the support of our lovely community and devs who have been with us in yet another great journey!
